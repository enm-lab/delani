## Setup/Installation Requirements
Open https://github.com/enm-lab/delani. On the top right corner of your screen, you should see a button with the text 'Fork'.
Clicking on this button should start the process of copying the project/repository to your own account.Click on that button which should result in a modal prompting you to choose the account to which you want to fork.
Select your account name which should take you to the repo you forked in your account. For example, if your GitHub username is 'enm-lab', you should select it and not anything else that appears in the modal. This may take a couple of seconds so be patient as the process takes place.
To know that the forking process is complete, check the top left corner of your repo. You should be in your account in a repo with the same name as the original repository. This shows that the forking process is complete.
Having copied the repo to your own account, you can then proceed to clone it.Run the git clone command to clone the repo to your preferred location.
Navigate to inside the cloned repository by using the change directory (cd) command.
